## Modulation of auditory gamma-band responses using transcranial electrical stimulation: Part 2 (2025)
### Follow up to [Modulation of auditory gamma-band responses using transcranial electrical stimulation](https://github.com/elizljohnson-projects/project-eeg-gamma-modulation.git)

Noninvasive brain stimulation is used across clinical, commercial, and research applications to change the brain in hopes of changing behavior, yet we don't fully understand how it changes brain activity. Using scalp EEG, we demonstrated that gamma frequency-tuned transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), but not transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), enhances auditory gamma responses in healthy adults ([Jones et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00003.2020)).

This project (Part 2) is a re-analysis of Jones et al., 2020 (Part 1), aiming to classify stimulation conditions from single-trial gamma-band steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs). Results demonstrate that machine learning with baseline-relative features can classify stimulation conditions (tACS, tDCS, Sham) at the single-trial level using data from a single EEG channel (Cz), achieving ~2Ã— better-than-chance accuracy.

Goal 1: Feature extraction and engineering
- Characterize gamma-band SSEPs using spectral decomposition, time-domain analysis, and cycle-by-cycle waveform analysis
- Extract 14 features spanning frequency-domain, temporal, and waveform morphology characteristics
- Engineer baseline-relative features to control for individual differences

Goal 2: Machine learning classification
- Compare classification algorithms
- Optimize hyperparameters using 2-stage randomized search
- Identify optimal features through importance ranking
- Validate model performance with permutation testing
