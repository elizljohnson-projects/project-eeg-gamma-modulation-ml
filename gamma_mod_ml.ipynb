        "This notebook extends findings from Jones et al., 2020, which showed that 40-Hz tACS, but not tDCS, increases gamma power during auditory click trains at the group level. There are two overarching goals:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Characterize gamma-band steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) and extract features for machine learning.** Using spectral decomposition (specparam), bandpass filtering, time-domain analysis (response latency, amplitude dynamics), and cycle-by-cycle waveform analysis (bycycle), extract comprehensive features spanning frequency-domain, temporal, and waveform morphology characteristics. Engineer baseline-relative features to capture stimulation-induced change while controlling for inter-individual baseline differences, creating a 14-feature dataset suitable for single-trial classification of stimulation conditions (tACS, tDCS, Sham).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Classify stimulation conditions using data from a single channel (Cz).** Compare classification algorithms (random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, SVM) using a 70/30 train/test split rather than leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to account for individual differences in stimulation response. Optimize hyperparameters using 2-stage randomized search, identify optimal features through importance ranking, and validate model performance with permutation testing. Demonstrate that within-subject baseline-relative features enable single-trial classification with ~2x better-than-chance accuracy (0.668 vs. 0.333), with cycle-by-cycle waveform features (amplitude) dominating spectral power measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key scientific findings**:\n",
        "- **Inter-individual variability in stimulation effects**: Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation failed (performance ~0.4), confirming that stimulation responses are  individual-specific and may not generalize across subjects without personalized calibration.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Within-subject normalization of single trials**: Baseline-relative features control for between-subject differences in baseline variability while preserving single-trial resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Importance of waveform dynamics**: Cycle-by-cycle amplitude (23.6% feature importance) dominates traditional spectral measures like peak power (4.1% importance), suggesting that oscillatory waveform shape captures stimulation effects more sensitively than conventional spectral analysis at the single-trial level.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Non-linear decision boundaries**: Tree-based models substantially outperform linear classifiers, indicating complex, non-linear relationships between EEG features and stimulation conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Real-world deployment feasibility**: The within-subject calibration strategy mirrors realistic scenarios where baseline data are collected before classifying ongoing stimulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results support the feasibility of real-time, personalized brain stimulation approaches where EEG signatures are used to adaptively monitor and optimize stimulation parameters on an individual basis.\n",

        "**Analysis overview**: Correlated features were identified and redundant variables removed to optimize the feature space for ML. The `rise_time` and `decay_time` features showed high correlation (r = 0.77) with `rise_decay_symmetry` and minimal discriminative value across conditions. These were dropped in favor of the symmetry metric. The `peak_voltage` feature was dropped due to minimal differences across conditions and redundancy with the `trough_voltage` feature (r = 0.78). To leverage the known effect of tACS on change from baseline and control for individual differences, baseline-relative features were computed for all stimulation trials. Each stimulation trial's features were then expressed as change from that subject's baseline, allowing single-trial classification while directly modeling the physiological effect of interest.\n",

This transformation models the known physiological effect (tACS-induced change from baseline) and mirrors realistic deployment scenarios where a baseline calibration period precedes stimulation. The resulting features span spectral (`peak_frequency`, `peak_power`, `peak_bandwidth`, `peak_snr`, `aperiodic_offset`, `aperiodic_slope`), temporal (`response_latency`, `amplitude_slope`, `autocorr_1cycle`), and waveform morphology (`amplitude`, `period`, `rise_decay_symmetry`, `trough_voltage`, `burst_rate`) domains, expressed as changes that should differentiate tACS from tDCS and sham conditions.

This within-subject calibration strategy mirrors realistic deployment scenarios where baseline trials are collected before classification of stimulation trials. A train/test split approach was used rather than leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to account for individual differences in stimulation response.
